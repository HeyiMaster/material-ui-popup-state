# es2015-library-skeleton

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jedwards1211/es2015-library-skeleton.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jedwards1211/es2015-library-skeleton)

This is my personal skeleton for creating an ES2015 library npm package.  You are welcome to use it.

## Tools used

* babel 6
* mocha
* chai
* isparta
* istanbul
* eslint
* eslint-watch
* flow
* flow-watch

The `prepublish` script checks the output of `eslint` and `flow` and runs tests.
