# es2015-library-skeleton

This is my personal skeleton for creating an ES2015 library component npm module.  You are welcome to use it.

## Tools used

* babel 6
* mocha
* chai
* sinon
* isparta
* istanbul
* eslint
* flow

The `prepublish` script checks the output of `eslint` and `flow` and runs tests.
