This is my personal skeleton for creating a React library npm package.  You are welcome to use it.

## Tools used

* babel 6
* mocha
* chai
* istanbul
* nyc
* babel-plugin-istanbul
* eslint
* eslint-watch
* flow
* flow-watch
* enzyme
* jsdom
* Travis CI
* Coveralls
* pre-commit (runs eslnt and flow)

The `prepublish` script checks the output of `eslint` and `flow` and runs tests.
